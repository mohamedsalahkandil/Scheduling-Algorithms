# Process Scheduling Algorithms

This repository contains Python implementations of various process scheduling algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script, and input data for testing the algorithms is provided in the `input.txt` file.

## Algorithms Included

1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS):**
   - Script: `fcfs.py`

2. **Shortest Job First (SJF):**
   - Script: `sjf.py`

3. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):**
   - Script: `srtf.py`

4. **Round Robin:**
   - Script: `round_robin.py`

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
